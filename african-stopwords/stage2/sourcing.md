## What this team will do:
- Decide on the domain to use for African stop words curation.
- Get diverse monolingual data for each of the focus languages. This data will be sent to the [African Stopwords - Coding Team](code.md) for the next step.  
- Document work done, as well as sources of monolingual data, on our Github.

## Workflow
- Each team member goes to a monolingual source for their language.
- They get the data (.txt) and upload to [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11tO917ezdjATB-Ct94mUYfBXf0aVCcuS?usp=sharing) (there will be a folder for each language. If there isnâ€™t, then you create one). `Folder name: IS0-639-3`. Consult [this](https://github.com/masakhane-io/masakhane-preprocessing/blob/main/african-stopwords/LANGUAGE-TABLE.md) for language name. 
- Filename of the data: __add data source in the filename__.
- If there are any issues write in the `#african-stopwords` channel (and cc Chris Emezue).

## Focus domains
- News
- social media domain
- religion
